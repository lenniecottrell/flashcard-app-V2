# CS Flashcards

## Description

This is a flashcard app to help me (and others eventually!) study programming and computer science concepts. It's made with PostgreSQL, Express, React, and Node.

The flashcard structure if based on a study technique I saw on LinkedIn called the "DICE" method, which stands for Definition, Information, Compare, and Example. If you can describe those four elements for any topic or concept, you know it pretty well!

This project is my first solo full-stack project.

## User Story

`AS A junior developer`
`I WANT an app that helps me study programming terminology`
`SO THAT I can deepen my knowledge about programming.`

## Progress

### 2/22/2021
Today I figured out how to dynamically render a drop down list of topics based on the information in the topics table. I also connected the drop down list selection to the component state, so it updates the title of the flashcard when a new topic is selected

### 2/11/2021 
I successfully implemented the fetch method to get data from the backend and render it on the frontend. I also added button functionality to make each button grab the proper answer, and I updated the style in the answer box component.

### 2/8/2021

I've refactored my components again to use Hooks instead of class components, and everything seems to be working. I removed the database information for now, but that's only because I'm going to study the fetch API a little deeper so I really understand it before I try to implement it.

At the moment I'm drilling all of my props from the top down. I know that it's not best practice, but I'm comfortable with it for now and it works. I plan to learn Redux for state management a little bit down the road, and I'll come back and refactor when I'm ready

The gap in my progress was because I took some time to learn more about React. It was worth the break!

### 1/26/2021

I have created the first draft of a UI, created the database and the API routes, and I just rendered database information to the flashcard yesterday. It renders the entire JSON response object, but it renders!

I'll continue to track progress as I go.
