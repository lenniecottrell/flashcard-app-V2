#CS Flashcards
This is a flashcard app to help me (and others eventually!) study programming and computer science concepts. It's made with PostgreSQL, Express, React, and Node.
This project is my first solo full-stack project. It's a work in progress. 

The flashcard structure if based on a study technique I saw on LinkedIn called the "DICE" method, which stands for Definition, Information, Context, and Example. If you can describe those four elements for any topic or concept, you know it pretty well!

##Progress

As of 1/26/2021, I have created the first draft of a UI, created the database and the API routes, and I just rendered database information to the flashcard yesterday. It renders the entire JSON response object, but it renders! 

I'll continue to track progress as I go.
