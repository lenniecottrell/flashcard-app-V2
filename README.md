# CS Flashcards

## Description

This is a flashcard app to help me (and others eventually!) study programming and computer science concepts. It's made with PostgreSQL, Express, React, and Node.
This project is my first solo full-stack project. It's a work in progress.

The flashcard structure if based on a study technique I saw on LinkedIn called the "DICE" method, which stands for Definition, Information, Context, and Example. If you can describe those four elements for any topic or concept, you know it pretty well!

## User Story

`AS A junior developer I WANT an app that helps me study programming terminology SO THAT I can deepen my knowledge about programming.`

## Progress

### 2/8/2021

I've refactored my components again to use Hooks instead of class components, and everything seems to be working. I removed the database information for now, but that's only because I'm going to study the fetch API a little deeper so I really understand it before I try to implement it.
I the gap in my progress was because I took some time to learn more about React. It was worth the break!

### 1/26/2021

I have created the first draft of a UI, created the database and the API routes, and I just rendered database information to the flashcard yesterday. It renders the entire JSON response object, but it renders!

I'll continue to track progress as I go.
